Hey everyone!

A new update is live, and it brings quite a few changes and improvements to the game. Here's what’s new:

🔄 Version Switcher (Legacy / BE)
You can now switch between the Legacy and BE versions of the game! This was one of the most requested features, and it’s finally here.

⚠️ A quick note about the BE version:
This isn’t the same as the original BE version some of you might remember. Unfortunately, I lost access to the old source code, which meant I had to recreate all the textures from scratch. There are still some issues with switching tetromino textures dynamically, so for now, the BE version stays in its classic form – but it's still available to download!

🎨 UI & UX Improvements
Updated several UI elements for a cleaner and more modern look.

Added a new pause menu with better navigation.

Improved translation support across the game.

Adden version indicator in main menu

Introduced two new tabs in the main menu:
Settings – adjust music volume and other preferences
Help – basic instructions and information for new players


🔊 New Music Volume Option
You can now adjust the music volume in the settings!

⚙️ Optimization & Bug Fixes
General performance improvements across devices.

Fixed several bugs and glitches.

🛍️ Store Page Updates
The Linux builds have been removed due to very low download numbers.

Store page now features greater transparency about the game's versions and status.

Next update will fix all bugs and will add pieces textures from BE version.

Thanks for sticking with me through development! I’m always working to improve the game, and your feedback is invaluable. Feel free to drop your thoughts or suggestions in the comments.

Cheers!
